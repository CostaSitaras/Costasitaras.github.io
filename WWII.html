<p><font size="7">T</font><font size="4">he involvement of Canada during the Second World War begins with the <font color=#C21A3E>German invasion of Poland</font> on 1 September 1939. While the Canadian Armed Forces were usually a part of most war, this centred more towards Italy, Northwestern Europe, and the North Atlantic. During the war, more than 1.1 million Canadians served in the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Canadian Air Force, and in forces across. More than 44,000 lost their lives during the war and 54,000 were wounded. The financial cost was $21.8 billion between 1939 and 1950. By the end of the war, Canada had the world's fourth largest air force, and fifth largest navy. The Canadian Navy completed over 25,000 voyages across the Atlantic, 130,000 Allied pilots were trained in Canada in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. On D-Day, 6 June 1944 the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division landed on "Juno" beach in Normandy, in conjunction with allied forces. The Second World War had significant cultural, political and economic effects on Canada, including a major crisis in 1944 which affected unity between Francophones and Anglophones. The war effort strengthened the Canadian economy and furthered Canada's global position.</p>
<br />Though Canada was the oldest Dominion in the British Commonwealth, it was, for the most part, reluctant to enter the war. Canada, with a population somewhere between 11 and 12 million, eventually raised very substantial armed forces. Around 10% of the entire population of Canada joined the army, with only a small portion conscripted. After the long struggle of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the challenges of the Second World War accelerated Canada's ongoing transformation into a modern urban and industrialized nation.</font>
