<p>On remembrance day members of the armed forces (soldiers, sailors and airmen) are commemorated.</p>

<p>The other common name for this day is Armistice Day which marks the date and time when armies stopped fighting, during World War I on November 11th at 11am in 1918, (the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month). Some 100,000 Canadian soldiers died in the First and Second World Wars.</p>

<p>In Canada, Remembrance Day is a federal holiday, with a notable exception of NS, NWT, ON and QC, as it is in many other countries in the world where this day is observed on the national level.</p>

<p>All government buildings hang the Canadian flag this day. Before we celebrate Rememberence day, lets inform ourselves with its history. Every year on Nomvember 11, we celebrate the end of the First Wolrd War. It officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, on 28 June 1919. On this important day, people usually pay their respects by wearing the red poppy.It is the emblem of Remembrance because of the poem "In Flanders Fields". Also people usually take a minute of silence to comemorate the brave sldiers who risked their lives to protect us.</p>
<p>The poem "In Flanders Fields" was written by Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae. </p>

	<p>In the United States this day is called Veteran's Day and is also observed on November 11.</p>
