<body>
<p><font size="7">T</font><font size="4">he history of Canada's history during World War I began on August 4, 1914, when the United Kingdom entered the First World War (1914 to 1918) by declaring war on Germany. The British declaration of war brought Canada into the war, because of Canada's legal status as a British colonie which left foreign policy decisions in the hands of the British parliament. However, the Canadian government had the freedom to determine the country's level of involvement in the war. On August 5, 1914, the Governor General declared a war between Canada and Germany.  There were many destructive battles during this war. Many canadian soldiers took part in the chaos. Men or women, young and old, black or white. Everyone participated in the war.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Canada's sacrifices and contributions to the Great War changed its history and enabled it to become more independent, while also opening relation between the French and English speaking populations. For the first time in Canadian  history, Canadian forces fought as a distinct unit, first under a British commander but ultimately under a Canadian-born commander.The highpoints of Canadian military achievement during the Great War came during the Somme, Vimy, and Passchendaele battles and what later became known as "Canada's Hundred Days". Canada's total deaths stood at the end of the war at 67,000 and 250,000 wounded, 620,000 people ended up being mobilized. Out of that amount 39% died later.</font></p>
